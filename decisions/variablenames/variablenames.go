// The general rule of thumb is that the length of a name should be proportional to the size of its scope and inversely
//proportional to the number of times that it is used within that scope. A variable created at file scope may require
//multiple words, whereas a variable scoped to a single inner block may be a single word or even just a character or
//two, to keep the code clear and avoid extraneous information.

//A name that might be perfectly clear (e.g., c for a counter) within a small scope could be insufficient in a larger
//scope and would require clarification to remind the reader of its purpose further along in the code. A scope in
//which there are many variables, or variables that represent similar values or concepts, may necessitate longer
//variable names than the scope suggests.

//The specificity of the concept can also help to keep a variableâ€™s name concise. For example, assuming there is only
//a single database in use, a short variable name like db that might normally be reserved for very small scopes may
//remain perfectly clear even if the scope is very large. In this case, a single word database is likely acceptable
//based on the size of the scope, but is not required as db is a very common shortening for the word with few
//alternate interpretations.

var variableWithBigScope = "hello"

// These numeric guidelines are not strict rules. Apply judgement based on context, clarity, and concision.
// A small scope is one in which one or two small operations are performed, say 1-7 lines.
func printer() {
	s := variableWithBigScope
	fmt.Println(s)
}

// A small scope is one in which one or two small operations are performed, say 1-7 lines.
func printerName(f, l string) {
	fmt.Printf("%s %s", f, l)
}

// A medium scope is a few small or one large operation, say 8-15 lines.
func superPrinter(firstName, lastName string) {
	fmt.Printf("Dear %s", firstName)

	// ... lot of code

	prefix := "Mr/Mrs"
	if lastName != "" {
		fmt.Printf("%s %s %s", prefix, firstName, lastName)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%s %s", prefix, firstName)

	// ... more code
}

//A large scope is one or a few large operations, say 15-25 lines.
//A very large scope is anything that spans more than a page (say, more than 25 lines).

//The name of a local variable should reflect what it contains and how it is being used in the current context, rather
//than where the value originated. For example, it is often the case that the best local variable name is not the same
//as the struct or protocol buffer field name.

//In general:
//Single-word names like `count` or `options` are a good starting point.
//Additional words can be added to disambiguate similar names, for example `userCount` and `projectCount`.
//Do not simply drop letters to save typing. For example `Sandbox` is preferred over `Sbx`, particularly for exported
//names.
//Omit types and type-like words from most variable names.
// * For a number, `userCount` is a better name than `numUsers` or `usersInt`.
// * For a slice, `users` is a better name than `userSlice`.
// * It is acceptable to include a type-like qualifier if there are two versions of a value in scope, for example you
//   might have an input stored in `ageString` and use `age` for the parsed value.
//Omit words that are clear from the surrounding context. For example, in the implementation of a UserCount method,
//a local variable called `userCount` is probably redundant; `count`, `users`, or even `c` are just as readable.
