package comments

// The conventions around commentary (which include what to comment, what style to use, how to provide runnable examples, etc.)
// are intended to support the experience of reading the documentation of a public API. See Effective Go <http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary> for more information.
//
// The best practices documentâ€™s section on documentation conventions <https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/best-practices#documentation-conventions> discusses this further.
//
// Best Practice: Use doc preview <https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/best-practices#documentation-preview> during development and code review to see whether the documentation and runnable examples are useful and are presented the way you expect them to be.
//
// Tip: Godoc uses very little special formatting; lists and code snippets should usually be indented to avoid linewrapping. Apart from indentation, decoration should generally be avoided.
